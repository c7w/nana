# --- Large Language Model (LLM) Configurations ---
# Define the different LLMs you want to use in your agents. You can add as many
# as you like. The key for each model (e.g., 'my_gpt_model') is a friendly name
# you will use to reference it in the 'agents' section below.
llms:
  # Example configuration for a model from OpenRouter
  # You can find model names and costs at https://openrouter.ai/models
  gpt-4o-mini:
    base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    api_key: "sk-or-v1-YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY" # <-- PASTE YOUR KEY HERE
    model: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
    cost: # Per 1 Million tokens
      input: 0.15
      output: 0.60

  # Example for another model. You can add models from other providers too.
  # Just ensure the base_url and api_key are correct for that provider.

# The values (e.g., 'gpt-4o-mini') must match one of the friendly names you
# defined in the 'llms' section above.
